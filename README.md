河海大学飞跃手册

Thanks for reading!

Here is Anton, who graduated in 2022, from HHU CIES.

Because of Covid19, I can have a clear view of myself. During the first quarter of **Stay At Home University**, I borrowed several books from the HHU library. One book named **The Super Guide to Philosophy** attracted me. This book introduces the origin of philosophy, with vivid words. Since then, I understood the relationship between democracy and society, science and politics. 

After I returned to school in 2020, due to the lockdown, students still can not go outside their campus easily. For me, I need to explain to my counselor why I need to go outside and when I come back so that the system will show the guard to let me in. This complex program became a huge obstacle for me. Even though I jump over the campus wall several times, many famous attractions were still closed, such as Confucius Temple, and many restaurants were closed either. In 2021 spring, I felt so sad. I can not go to Jiming Temple or Qixia Mountain with my girlfriend. I was wondering why society has become like this. Finally, I draw the conclusion that the arrogance of the manager.

So, I read some books related to management and government. I found that the power of the government is a collection of people's rights that they choose to abandon. The more people abandon it, the more powerful government. And because the government is too huge compared to the individual, it usually becomes so powerful that harm people's well-being. Hundreds of years passed, and people have found many ways to solve this problem. The first way is that we can hold an armed uprising to subvert the authority. However, the new government usually becomes as powerful as the previous is, and it would be subverted too, just like a circle. Another way is that we can design a system to avoid the gathering of the power of the governor, also known as democracy.

This handbook introduces some simple related to *Run Philosophy* - Why run, Where run, and How to run - from a young undergraduate view. There are so many personal views, so do not argue with me about what is right and what is wrong. If you do not like it, just close the tab and do what you want to do.

Thanks for reading again!
